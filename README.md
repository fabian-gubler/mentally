# Work in Progress
Experimental Landing Page created to validate our Startup Idea "Mental.ly" 

## Experiments Conducted
- We integrated matomo into our webpage to enable advanced tracking. 
- This allowed us to measure various information on customer demographic and their behavior on our site.
- In addition, by linking to a google form, we could obtain further information on our potential users.

## Upcoming Tasks
- Use Online Advertising to drive traffic to the site
