## Experiments conducted
Our landing page utilized advanced analytics and tracking tools to monitor user behavior and evaluate the success of different experiments. To gather insights into user behavior and preferences, we conducted a number of experiments on our landing page, including:

- Integration of Matomo for advanced tracking, enabling measurement of various customer demographics and behavior on our site
