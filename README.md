## Overview

As part of the **Venture Creation course**, we developed the mental health startup idea **"Mental.ly"** from the ground up, covering everything from conception to pitch. To validate and promote our idea, we created an **experimental landing page**. This page not only served as a promotional tool but also helped us conduct various user experiments to gauge the viability of the startup.

Through user interactions tracked on the page, we gained valuable insights into user behavior, enabling us to refine our business model and pitch.

## Key Features

- Full startup lifecycle development: from ideation to pitch.
- Creation of a landing page to promote the startup **Mental.ly**.
- Conducted user experiments to validate and test the startup idea.
- Employed **advanced analytics** with **Matomo** to monitor and track user interactions.
- Gained user insights to iterate and refine the business model.

## Experiments Conducted

To gather actionable insights, we conducted several experiments on the landing page:

1. **User Behavior Tracking**:  
   We integrated **Matomo** for in-depth analytics, measuring customer demographics, site interactions, and user behavior on the landing page.

2. **User Feedback Collection**:  
   Linked to a **Google Form** to collect additional insights from potential users, helping us understand their needs and preferences.

By analyzing the data from these experiments, we were able to fine-tune our startupâ€™s pitch and adapt our business model to better align with user expectations.
